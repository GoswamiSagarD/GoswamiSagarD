## Project Portfolio

### Professional Experience

#### Customer Segmentation
- Performed data clustering on the Sales data to segregate customers into clusters based on various factors extracted from previous sales for a medical equipment manufacturing client.
- Performed exploratory analytics and extracted additional metrics to differentiate various sales traits of customers like sale frequency, revenue generation, seasonal components, products purchased, etc.
- Used `Python` and `scikit-learn` library on `AzureML` to test various clustering algorithms.
- These clusters are used by the marketing department to formulate various personalized and targeted marketing strategies.

#### Sales Prediction and Seasonality Analysis
- Performed exploratory analytics on the sales data to analyze seasonality and sales trend of various products, sold by a medical equipment manufacturing client. Identified product SKUs that inhibited significant seasonality component and predicted future sales for those products.
- Used `Python`, `prophet`, and `scikit-learn` library on `AzureML`.
- These predictions were later used for reporting purposes.

#### Predicting Patient Admits for Hospice and Home-health Services based on Referrals Data obtained from Physicians/Healthcare facilities
- Analyzed Referrals Database to predict patient admission for Home-Health and Hospice Services.
- Tested various classification algorithms (`Logistic Regression`, `Decision Trees`, `Random Forest`, `Naïve-Bayes`, and `Support Vector Machines`) for predictions.
- Used Python and sci-kit-learn library on a remote machine on `Microsoft Azure`.
- Developed a custom python library (based on `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`) to automate ML Model training, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation and testing, computing, and comparing predictions accuracies/RMSE for various algorithms/models, making predictions and merging them to the dataset, generating plots for model performance (confusion matrix, error plots)

#### Azure Synapse (POC for Data Mining Project Lifecycle)
- Created a POC (Proof of Concept) to test the capabilities and limitations of `Azure Synapse` Platform to carry out the entire Data Science Project, from data ingestion to data mining and reporting/dashboards.
- Performed Data Exploration and Data Analysis in Synapse Spark using `Spark-SQL` and `PySpark` Notebooks. Performed Data Mining on Census Data (`Correlation Tests`, `Trend Analysis` and `Future Projecting`, `Multi-Variate Regression`, and `Polynomial Regression`) using `SparkML`.
- Integrated Azure Synapse with various data sources (`Azure Data Lake`, External RDBMS, and `Microsoft SharePoint`) and external reporting tools (`PowerBI` and `Tableau`) to store data and prepare Dashboards/Reports to visualize the insights obtained from Data Analytics and Mining.
- Automated the entire process using `Azure Synapse Pipelines` and `Azure Data factory`.

### Academic Projects
- `Image Classification` using `Convolutional Neural Networks` with Python and Tensorflow to differentiate images of cats and dogs 
- Analyzing and `predicting traffic speeds` for New York City using `Clustering`, `PCA`, and `Time-Series Analysis` (Apache Spark on Databricks, NYC Department of Transportation API, Spark MLlib, ML Pipelines, Facebook’s FBProphet library, PySpark, SparkSQL, SparkR)
- `Optimized the Production and Distribution Network` using Linear Programming and Heuristic Methods, for an Automobile Manufacturing Company. (Python, Gurobi, gurobipy API, Linear Programming, Heuristic Optimization techniques)
- Analyzing and `predicting the Average Life Expectancy` of countries using WHO Open Data. (R-Language)
- `Classifying Wines` based on their features (Data Mining, Python, sci-kit-learn)
- `Designed and developed a relational database` for storing and maintaining the daily nutrition intake of users. The database stores various recipes, their nutritional contents, user information, their daily dietary targets/requirements, and meals consumed by users. (Relational Databases, SQL, Oracle SQL Server)
- `Predicting Bike-Sharing Service Demand` based on previous data history, and external factors like Weather, Holidays, etc. (R-Language, Python, Regression Models, Feature Selection Techniques, Tree Models, Ensemble Models, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, automation, Hypothesis-Testing)
- `Analyzing Means of Commute to Work and Public Transportation usage` in the United States using U.S. Census Bureau Data. (Python, R-Language, SQL, OpenData API)
